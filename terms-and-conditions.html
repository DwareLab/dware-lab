                    <p>
                        We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for reasons including but not limited to: product or service availability, errors in the description or price of the product or service, error in your order or other reasons.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an unauthorized or illegal transaction is suspected.
                    </p>

                    <h4>3. Availability, Errors and Inaccuracies</h4>
                    <p>
                        We are constantly updating product and service offerings on the Service. We may experience delays in updating information on the Service and in our advertising on other web sites. The information found on the Service may contain errors or inaccuracies and may not be complete or current.

                    <h4>4. Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions</h4>
                    <p>
                        Any contests, sweepstakes or other promotions (collectively, "Promotions") made available through the Service may be governed by rules that are separate from these Terms & Conditions. If you participate in any Promotions, please review the applicable rules as well as our Privacy Policy. If the rules for a Promotion conflict with these Terms and Conditions, the Promotion rules will apply.
                    </p>

                    <h4>5. Subscriptions</h4>
                    <p>
                        Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Dware cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Dware customer support team.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Dware with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Dware to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Dware will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
                    </p>

                    <h4>6. Fee Changes</h4>
                    <p>
                        Dware, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Dware will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.
                    </p>
